This project will end up consisting of a few little programs revolving around Markov Chains. As such, it is mor of a private project, where I will have a look at Haskell and GitHub (as well as actually following along the course this is based on). I decided to just make it public anyways, because, why not? Maybe some of the code turns out to be interesting to someone stopping by. If you find some issues in the code, or think something should be changed because I'm following bad practices, do let me know.
